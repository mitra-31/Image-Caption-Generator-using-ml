# Image Caption Generator

Image captioning used to be a difficult task, and the captions that were created for the supplied image were not often related. There are many tasks that are difficult to perform using Machine Learning became easier to apply with the introduction of Deep Learning Neural Networks and  Natural Language Processing. Some of the Deep Learning techniques that are helpful in various image activities such as image detection, classification of images, description of images, and other vivid AI applications.

## Abstract

Using deep learning and computer vision, image caption generation identifies the context of an image and comments on it with the most relevant captions. It entails an image's epithet combined with English keywords, as well as datasets provided during model training. We produce a vectorized representation of an image using a deep Convolutional neural network, which is then fed into a long-short-term memory (LSTM) network, which provides captions. LSTM (Long short-term memory) is also one of the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) constructs, mainly utilized in the deep learning discipline. The vivid applications of image captioning are natural language processing applications, recommendations in editing applications, helpful for virtual assistants, for indexing the image, for the blind or partially-sighted people, for the internet community, etc.
